# sqlalchemy-challenge

Module Ten Challenge

In this assignment I used Bing AI, Chat GPT, stack overflow and the class slides to analyzethe climate data and make a climate app. For part 1 I had to open a sqlalchemy session, find the most recent date in the data set and then go back one year into the data. I was able to show the precipitation rates for the last year as well as find the stations and get the tobs.

I then created a flask api by setting up my routes and pulling data. Then used jsonify to make a valid json response object.
